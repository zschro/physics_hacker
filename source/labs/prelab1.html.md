Introduction to Planetoids (Coordinate System)
==============================================

Below is the planetoids game that you will ultimately program in Lab 1. The purpose of this "introduction" is to emphasize that **the coordinate system is centered in the top left of the screen.** Therefore the origin x = 0, y = 0 is in the top left of the screen. It is also important to appreciate that y increases towards the bottom of the screen. This is why +y points down in the planetoids game below and +x points to the right like normal.

This is reminiscent of falling object problems where downward motion is positive. Besides that everything is the same.
